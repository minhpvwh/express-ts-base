# Base REST

A project made for the free _Building a Node.js/TypeScript REST API.

This branch contains some setup for linting and prettifying code that is outside the scope of the series.

In addition to the inclusion of `.eslintrc.json` and `.prettierrc` files, some development dependencies were added to `package.json`, namely `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin eslint-plugin-mocha eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-config-prettier`.

You likely have to `npm i -g prettier` as well.

From here (after running `npm i`) there are two things you can do.

## One-time Prettification

For this, you can go to the project root, and run:

``` sh
find . -name '*.js' -or -name '*.ts' | grep -v .history | grep -v dist | grep -v node_modules | xargs prettier --write --single-quote
```

## Continuous Prettification and Linting

In this scenario, whenever you save a file in VSCode (or VSCodium) that you were working on, it automatically runs Prettier and ESLint on it.

To set it up, find your `settings.json` file (e.g., `~/.config/VSCodium/User/settings.json`) and add these lines to it:

``` json
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  }
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "eslint.validate": ["typescript", "javascript"]
```

With that, try making some changes to the project, like adding a line `const neverused    =1;`.  If all went well, Prettier will reformat your code for you, and ESLint will generate warnings in the Problems pane about the unused variable `neverused`.
